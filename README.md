# Battleships
Battleships console game in c#  

A classic battle ships game I made during the first programming course. Exploring different OOP principles like inheritance and interfaces.
I also used an recursive algorithm for placing the ships. The AI-player fires at random available locations. The code has not been updated since.

Very basic graphics. Only using arrays and integers.
